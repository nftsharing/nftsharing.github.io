# Welcome to Official Homepage of NFTSharing
We startup NTF collections on opensea to bring you health, wealth and happiness, as follows,
 
## 1. BandagemanNFT
[BandagemanNFT](https://opensea.io/collection/bandagemannft) is a collection of 10,000 unique Bandage Man NFTs, which comes from the idea that we always bond ourselves to hard problems, hope to be free and fear to be forward. We hope these NFTs can help us to find the right way and seek the inner-heart peace.

## 2. VacuumBear
[VacuumBear](https://opensea.io/collection/vacuumbear) is a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, which comes from the fact that we wear surgical masks all over the world. Masks make a big distance between everyone. In the future, thing will become well that we don't need to live in vacuums, like a VacuumBear.
